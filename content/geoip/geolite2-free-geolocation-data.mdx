title: GeoLite2 Free Geolocation Data
---

import IPGeolocationUsage from './docs/databases/_ip-geolocation-usage';

GeoLite2 databases are free IP geolocation databases comparable to, but less
accurate than, [MaxMind’s GeoIP2
databases](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-databases). The [GeoLite2 Country,
City, and ASN
databases](/pdf-files/GeoLite2-IP-MetaData-Databases-Comparison-Chart.pdf) are
updated weekly, every Tuesday. GeoLite2 data is also available as a web service
in the [GeoLite2 Country and GeoLite2 City web
services](GeoLite2-and-GeoIP2-Precision-Web-Services-Comparison.pdf) (users are
limited to 1000 IP address lookups per service per day).

## IP Geolocation Usage

IP geolocation is inherently imprecise. Locations are often near the center of
the population. Any location provided by a GeoIP database should not be used
to identify a particular address or household.

Use the Accuracy Radius as an indication of geolocation accuracy for the
latitude and longitude coordinates we return for an IP address. The actual
location of the IP address is likely within the area defined by this radius and
the latitude and longitude coordinates.

You can compare accuracy of the GeoLite2 data and MaxMind's paid GeoIP2
products by selecting a country on our [GeoIP2 City Accuracy
page](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-city-accuracy-comparison).

## Accessing GeoLite2 Free Geolocation Data

<Alert type="info">
To receive download access to GeoLite2 databases or query access to GeoLite2
web services at no charge, [sign up for a GeoLite2
account](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup)
</Alert>

Once you’ve set up an account, login to your [account
portal](https://www.maxmind.com/en/account/login) and select “Download
Databases” to access the databases, or generate a license key to begin querying
the web services (see more information in the [Integration](#integration)
section below). You may also be interested in our guide to [Getting Started
with GeoLite2](https://support.maxmind.com/getting-started-with-geolite2/).

## Integration

GeoLite2 databases and web services use nearly the same integration steps as
our paid GeoIP2 databases and web services.  In fact, our client API libraries
can be used for both GeoIP2 and GeoLite2 products, making transitioning from
the free GeoLite2 product line to the paid GeoIP2 product line extremely easy.

### Databases

See our [Database Documentation
page](/geoip/docs/databases#official-api-clients) for a list of available APIs.
GeoIP2 APIs may be used with GeoLite2 binary databases (MMDB).

### Web services 

Web services. See our [Web Services Documentation
page](/geoip/docs/web-services) for a list of available web
service APIs. GeoIP2 Precision APIs may be used with the GeoLite2 web services.
[GeoLite2 web service URIs can be found here](/geoip/docs/web-services/requests#geolite2-endpoints).

You can also review our brief tutorial on [how to integrate the GeoLite2 City
web service using PHP on our
blog](https://blog.maxmind.com/2021/01/11/integrating-maxminds-free-and-paid-ip-geolocation-web-services-in-php/)
