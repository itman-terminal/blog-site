title: Normalizing Email Addresses for minFraud
---

When providing an email address as an input to the minFraud services, you can
provide it either as plain text or as an MD5 hash.

If you provide the email as an MD5 hash, itâ€™s important that you normalize it
before generating the hash. Otherwise minor, inconsequential differences could
cause minFraud to consider it a different address.

Our [API clients](/minfraud/api-documentation/#api-clients) do this for you if
you enable sending the MD5 hash. This is the recommended way to do this.

## Normalizing email addresses
If you are not able to use our API clients, you can normalize an email address
yourself. Below are the steps to take to do this.

Trim whitespace from both ends of the address

1. Lowercase the address.
1. Find the local part of the email (before the `@`) and the domain (after the
`@`).
1. Trim whitespace from both ends of the domain.
1. If the domain ends with a period, trim it off.
1. Convert international domain names (IDNs) to ASCII. For example, you can do
this in Java using [java.net.IDN](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/IDN.html).
1. Fix common typos in domain names. You can see a list of typos we map in our
[Java API client](https://github.com/maxmind/minfraud-api-java/blob/main/src/main/java/com/maxmind/minfraud/request/Email.java#L24).
1. Remove alias parts from the local part. For `yahoo.com` addresses, this is
everything after and including the first `-` character, if present. For
`gmail.com` addresses, this is everything after and including the first `+`
character, if present.
1. Put the local part and the domain back together to form the normalized email
address.
1. Calculate the MD5 hash.
