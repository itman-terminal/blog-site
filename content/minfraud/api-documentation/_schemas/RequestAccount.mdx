    name="user_id"
    type="string"
  >
    A unique user ID associated with the end-user in your system. If your system
    allows the login name for the account to be changed, this should not be the
    login name for the account, but rather should be an internal ID that does
    not change. This is not your MaxMind account ID. No specific format is
    required.

    must be within the past 10 years. If this field is not in the request, the
