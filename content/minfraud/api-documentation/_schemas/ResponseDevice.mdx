  This object contains information about the device that MaxMind believes is
  associated with the IP address passed in the request.

  <Property
    example=""
    name="confidence"
    tags={{
      'Format': 'Decimal',
      'Min': 0.01,
      'Max': 99,
    }}
    type="number"
  >
    A number from 0.01 to 99 representing the confidence that the `/device/id`
    refers to a unique device as opposed to a cluster of similar devices. A
    confidence of 0.01 indicates very low confidence that the device is unique,
    whereas 99 indicates very high confidence.
  </Property>

  <Property
    example=""
    name="id"
    tags={{
      'Format': 'UUID',
    }}
    type="string"
  >
    A UUID that MaxMind uses for the device associated with this IP address.
    Note that many devices cannot be uniquely identified because they are too
    common (for example, all iPhones of a given model and OS release). In these
    cases, the minFraud service will simply not return a UUID for that device.
    This is only available if you are using the [Device Tracking Add-on](#).

    This is determined by using the UTC offset associated with the device.
    The value is formatted according to [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).
