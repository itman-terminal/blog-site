This plugin is taken from [New Relic's docs website](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/tree/release-220/plugins/gatsby-remark-mdx-v2-images) as a fix for the following
bug: [MDX v2 breaks Markdown images with gatsby-remark-images](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/26662)

Note that a `package.json` is required by Gatsby for a local plugin, but none of
it's contents are read. Thus, the `package.json` file is intentionally empty. ðŸ¤·
